<p>After basic processing, teas may be altered through additional processing steps before being 
sold and is often consumed with additions to the basic tea leaf and water added during 
preparation or drinking. Examples of additional processing steps that occur before tea is 
sold are blending, flavouring, scenting, and decaffeination of teas. Examples of additions 
added at the point of consumption include milk, sugar and lemon.</p>

<p>Tea blending is the combination of different teas together to achieve the final product. 
Such teas may combine others from the same cultivation area or several different ones. The 
aim is to obtain consistency, better taste, higher price, or some combination of the three.</p>

<p>Flavoured and scented teas add aromas and flavours to the base tea. This can be accomplished 
through directly adding flavouring agents, such as ginger, cloves, mint leaves, cardamom, 
bergamot (found in Earl Grey), vanilla, and spearmint. Alternatively, because tea easily 
retains odours, it can be placed in proximity to an aromatic ingredient to absorb its aroma, 
as in traditional jasmine tea. Black tea is often taken with milk.</p>

<p>The addition of milk to tea in Europe was first mentioned in 1680 by the epistolist Madame 
de Sévigné. Many teas are traditionally drunk with milk in cultures where dairy products 
are consumed. These include Indian masala chai and British tea blends. These teas tend to be 
very hearty varieties of black tea which can be tasted through the milk, such as Assams, 
or the East Friesian blend. Milk is thought to neutralise remaining tannins and reduce 
acidity. The Han Chinese do not usually drink milk with tea but the Manchus do, 
and the elite of the Qing Dynasty of the Chinese Empire continued to do so. Hong Kong-style 
milk tea is based on British habits. Tibetans and other Himalayan peoples traditionally 
drink tea with milk or yak butter and salt. In Eastern European countries, Russia and Italy, 
tea is commonly served with lemon juice. In Poland, tea is traditionally served with a slice 
of lemon and is sweetened with either sugar or honey; tea with milk is called a bawarka 
("Bavarian style") in Polish and is also widely popular. In Australia, tea with milk is 
known as "white tea".</p>
