<p>Tea is generally divided into categories based on how it is processed.</p> 

<p>At least six different types are produced:
<ul>
   <li>White: wilted and unoxidized</li>
   <li>Yellow: unwilted and unoxidized but allowed to yellow</li>
   <li>Green: unwilted and unoxidized</li>
   <li>Oolong: wilted, bruised, and partially oxidized</li>
   <li>Black: wilted, sometimes crushed, and fully oxidized (called 紅茶 [hóngchá], 
   "red tea" in Chinese and other East Asian tea culture)</li>
   <li>Post-fermented (Dark): green tea that has been allowed to ferment/compost</li>
</ul>	
</p>

<p>After picking, the leaves of C. sinensis soon begin to wilt and oxidize unless immediately 
dried. An enzymatic oxidation process triggered by the plant's intracellular enzymes causes 
the leaves to turn progressively darker as their chlorophyll breaks down and tannins are 
released. This darkening is stopped at a predetermined stage by heating, which deactivates 
the enzymes responsible. In the production of black teas, halting by heating is carried out 
simultaneously with drying. Without careful moisture and temperature control during 
manufacture and packaging, growth of undesired molds and bacteria may make tea unfit for 
consumption.</p>
