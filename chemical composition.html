<h1>Chemical composition</h1>

<section>
<h3>Water-soluble compounds</h3>

<p>Tea has properties of both a solution and a suspension. It is a solution
of all the water-soluble compounds that have been extracted from the tea leaves, such as the 
polyphenols and amino acids, but is a suspension when all of the insoluble components are 
considered, such as the cellulose in the tea leaves.</p>

<h3 id="caffeine">Caffeine</h3>

<p>Caffeine constitutes about 3% of tea's dry weight, translating to between 30 and 90 
milligrams per 250-millilitre (8+1⁄2 US fl oz) cup depending on the type, brand, 
and brewing method. A study found that the caffeine content of one gram of black tea ranged 
from 22–28 mg, while the caffeine content of one gram of green tea ranged from 11–20 mg, 
reflecting a significant difference.</p>

<section>
<h3 id="theobromine">Theobromine</h3>
 
<p>Tea also contains small amounts of theobromine and 
theophylline, which are stimulants, and xanthines similar to caffeine.Fresh tea leaves 
in various stages of growth.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="nutrients">Nutrients</h3>

<p>Black and green teas contain no essential nutrients in significant amounts, with 
the exception of the dietary mineral manganese, at 0.5 mg per cup or 26% of the Reference 
Daily Intake (RDI). Fluoride is sometimes present in tea; certain types of "brick tea", 
made from old leaves and stems, have the highest levels, enough to pose a health risk 
if much tea is drunk, which has been attributed to high levels of fluoride in soils, 
acidic soils, and long brewing.</p>
</section>

<section>
<h3 id="polyphenols">Polyphenols</h3>

<p>The astringency in tea can be attributed to the presence of polyphenols. These are the most 
abundant compounds in tea leaves, making up 30–40% of their composition. 
Polyphenols include flavonoids, epigallocatechin gallate, and other catechins. 
Although there has been preliminary clinical research on whether green or black teas may 
protect against various human diseases, there is no evidence that tea polyphenols have any 
effect on health or lowering disease risk.</p>
